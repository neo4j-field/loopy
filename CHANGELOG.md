# Changelog

All notable changes to Loopy will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: The `-d` short flag now selects `--database` instead of `--duration`.
  Use `-D`/`--duration` to set test duration in seconds.
- `run` help output now groups options into headed sections (Connection, Execution, YAML
  Workload, Transaction Mode, Output & Reporting), shows default values, and includes usage
  examples in a footer.
- `benchmark` and `test-connection` now share the same `--neo4j-uri`/`--username`/`--password`
  option definitions as `run`, for consistent descriptions and behavior.

### Added
- `--database`/`-d` option to select the Neo4j database to connect to (default: `neo4j`),
  supported by `run`, `benchmark`, and `test-connection`. Also configurable via the
  `LOOPY_DATABASE` environment variable or the `neo4j.database` config property.

### Fixed
- `loopy run --help` showed only `-h`/`-V` — all other options were defined on the parent
  `loopy` command and were never visible (or usable) on the `run` subcommand itself.
- `docs/INSTALL.md` example referenced a non-existent `--workload` option; corrected to
  `--cypher-file`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **Simplified distribution structure** - Wrapper scripts now at distribution root
  - No more `bin/` subdirectory
  - Run directly: `./loopy --help` or add distribution folder to PATH
- Cleaner user experience for direct execution

### Notes
- PATH should now point to the distribution directory itself (e.g., `/path/to/loopy-0.3.0`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Cross-platform wrapper scripts** - Run `loopy` directly without `java -jar` prefix
  - `loopy` - Unix shell script for macOS/Linux
  - `loopy.bat` - Windows CMD batch script
  - `loopy.ps1` - Windows PowerShell script
- **Automatic Java detection** with version validation (requires Java 21+)
- **Environment variable support** - `JAVA_HOME`, `LOOPY_HOME`, `LOOPY_JAVA_OPTS`
- **Comprehensive installation guide** - [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)
- **Multi-platform CI testing** - Wrapper scripts tested on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows

### Changed
- Distribution structure reorganized:
  - JAR moved to `lib/` directory
  - Wrapper scripts at distribution root
  - Documentation references updated to use `loopy` command

### Notes
- JAR filename retains version string for traceability
- Wrapper scripts dynamically locate versioned JAR
